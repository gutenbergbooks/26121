<h3><a name="DR_WHICHCOTE_MICHAEL_AYNSWORTH_AND_LORD"
id="DR_WHICHCOTE_MICHAEL_AYNSWORTH_AND_LORD"></a>DR. WHICHCOTE, MICHAEL
AYNSWORTH, AND LORD SHAFTESBURY.</h3>

<p>Not less remarkable and interesting than the
publication of Dr. Whichcote's Sermons by the
noble author of the <i>Characteristics</i>, is a posthumous
volume (though never designed for the press)
under the following title:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Several Letters written by a Noble Lord to a
Young Man at the University.</p>

<p>"Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem
Testa diu.&mdash;<i>Hor. Epist.</i> ii. 1.</p>

<p>"Printed for J. Roberts, near the Oxford Arms, in
Warwick Lane, 1716. 8vo."</p></blockquote>

<p>The young man was Michael Aynsworth, of
University College, Oxford, afterwards vicar of
Cornhampton, in Hampshire, and master of the
Free School there. He was a native of Dorsetshire;
his father, who was in narrow circumstances,
living near Wimborne St. Giles's, the seat of Lord
Shaftesbury, by whom the son seems to have been
nobly patronised, on account of his inclination to
learning and virtuous disposition.</p>

<p>The published letters are only <i>ten</i> in number;
but I have an accurate manuscript transcript of
<i>fifteen</i>, made from the originals by R. Flexman
(who had been a pupil of Aynsworth) in 1768.
The transcriber's account is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"After Mr. Aynsworth's death, these letters remained
in the possession of his daughter, and at her
decease passed into the the hands of the Rev. Mr. Upton,
the then vicar of Cornhampton; by him they were lent
to my brother John Baker, of Grove Place, in Hampshire,
who lent them to me. It will be perceived that
the ten printed letters are not given as they were written,
every thing of a private nature being omitted, and passages
only given of other letters, just as the editor
judged proper."</p></blockquote>

<p>R. Flexman has made some remarks illustrative
of the letters at the end of his transcript, and
added some particulars relating to Lord Shaftesbury.
He justly says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I think these letters will show his lordship in a
more favourable light with respect to the Christian religion
than his <i>Characteristics</i>, which, though they may
be condemned on that account, will ever remain a
lasting monument of the genius of the noble writer.
It is certain, too, the friends of Christianity are obliged
to him for the publication of one of the best volumes
of sermons that ever appeared in the English language.
They are twelve in number, by Dr. Benjamin Whichcote.
These sermons (as well as the preface, which
is admirable) breathe such a noble spirit of Christianity,
as I think will efface every notion that his lordship
was an enemy to the Christian religion. In this
preface he calls Dr. Whichcote (from his pleading in
defence of natural goodness) the 'preacher of good
nature.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>What follows will, I think, be acceptable to your
correspondents C H. and C. R. S.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have heard that the way in which Lord Shaftesbury
got possession of the manuscript sermons was
this:&mdash;Going one day to visit his grandmother, the
Countess Dowager, widow of the first Earl, he found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>her reading a manuscript; on inquiring what she was
reading, she replied, that it was a sermon. His lordship
expressed his surprise that she should take so
much trouble as to read a manuscript sermon when
there were such numbers in print. She said, she could
find none so good as those she had in manuscript. Lord
Shaftesbury then requested the favour of being allowed
to peruse it, and having done so, he inquired of the
Countess if she had any more, as he should like to read
them all if she had. Having received and read them,
he was so much pleased, that he resolved to print them;
and having them prepared for the press, he published
them with a preface recommending the sermons and
highly praising the author."</p></blockquote>

<p>It appears that the sermons were prepared for
the press, at Lord Shaftesbury's instance, by the
Rev. William Stephens, rector of Sutton, in
Surrey; but the fact of the preface being by himself
rests on the undoubted evidence of his sister, Lady
Betty Harris (wife of James Harris of Salisbury,
the author of <i>Hermes</i>), who mentioned having
written it from her brother's dictation, he being at
that time too ill to write himself.</p>

<p>The letters to Michael Aynsworth are very interesting,
from their benevolent, earnest, and truly
pious spirit, and might even now be read with
advantage by a young student of theology: but,
being very severe in many places upon the greater
part of the body of the clergy <i>called</i> the Church
of England, could have been by no means palatable
to the High Church party,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Who no more esteem themselves a Protestant
Church, or in union with those of Protestant communion,
though they pretend to the name of Christian,
and would have us judge of the spirit of Christianity
from theirs; which God prevent! lest men should in
time forsake Christianity through their means."</p></blockquote>

<p>The eleventh letter in the MS. is important on
account of the observations it contains on the
consequences which must inevitably arise from Locke's
doctrine respecting innate ideas. Locke had been
tutor both to Lord Shaftesbury and his father:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Locke, much as I honour him, and well as I
know him, and can answer for his sincerity as a most
zealous Christian believer, has espoused those
principles which Mr. Hobbes set on foot in the last century,
and has been followed by the Tindals and all the other
free authors of our time. 'Twas Mr. Locke that
struck the home blow, (for Hobbes' character and base
slavish principles of government took off the poison of
his philosophy), struck at all fundamentals, threw all
<i>order</i> and <i>virtue</i> out of the world, and made the very
<i>ideas</i> of these (which are the same as those of God),
unnatural and without foundation in our minds."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is remarkable that the volume of Whichcote's
Sermons printed by Lord Shaftesbury should have
been republished at Edinburgh in 1742, with a
recommendatory epistle, by a Presbyterian divine,
Dr. Wishart, principal of the College of Edinburgh.
In the very neat reprint of the collected sermons
given by Dr. Campbell and Dr. Gerard, in 4 vols.,
8vo., Aberdeen, 1751, prefixed to the third volume,
we also find Lord Shaftesbury's preface.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_REBEL" id="THE_REBEL"></a>THE REBEL.</h3>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The printed copy of a song which I inclose
is believed, by those who are the best judges,
to be the only copy, either printed or in manuscript,
now in existence. That circumstance may,
perhaps, render it acceptable to you: and I am not
collector of curiosities, and I beg you would do
what you please with it. The verses are plainly
more modern than the motto: for there are, I
think, two allusions to different plays of the
immortal bard of Stratford-on-Avon. But perhaps
you will think that he copied from it, as it is said
he sometimes did from things not so good as his
own. I do not believe, for my own part, that it
was written till after the Great Rebellion. Bishop
Christopherson, I take it, was a Roman Catholic,
but resident in England, and we see that he wrote
in English. The paper, you will observe, is foreign
by the texture, as well as by the water-mark,
which I cannot very well make out; but it seems
to be a bust of somebody; while the type looks
quite English, and therefore it is no proof that
it was printed abroad.</p>

<p>As I give you my real name, I hope you will
not consider me as holding, or wishing to recommend,
such opinions as are contained in the verses:
and by way of protest, you will allow me to
subscribe myself, your obedient servant,</p>

<p>P.S. Query, What is a "hodipeke?" Is it a
"hypocrite?" and should not "Ph&aelig;bus," in the
fourth verse, be "Ph&#339;bus?"</p>

<hr class="short section" />

<h3><a name="THE_HIPPOPOTAMUS" id="THE_HIPPOPOTAMUS"></a>THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.</h3>

<p>The earliest mention of the hippopotamus is in
Herodotus, who in ii. 71. gives a detailed description
of this inhabitant of the Nile. He is stated by
Porphyry to have borrowed this description from
his predecessor Hecat&aelig;us (Frag. 292. ap. <i>Hist. Gr.
Fragm.</i>, vol. i. ed. Didot). Herodotus, however,
had doubtless obtained his account of the hippopotamus
during his visit to Egypt. Cuvier (<i>Trad.
de Pline</i>, par Grandsagne, tom. vi. p. 444.) remarks
that the description is only accurate as to the teeth
and the skin; but that it is erroneous as to the
size, the feet, the tail and mane, and the nose.
He wonders, therefore, that it should have been
repeated, with few corrections or additions, by
Aristotle (<i>Hist. An.</i>, ii. 1. and 7.; viii. 24.) and
Diodorus (i. 35.). Compare Camus, <i>Notes sur
l'Histoire des Animaux d'Aristote</i>, p. 418.</p>

<p>None of the Greek writers appear to have seen
a live hippopotamus; nor is there any account of a
live animal of this species having been brought to
Greece, like the live tiger which Seleucus sent to
Athens. According to Pliny (<i>H. N.</i>, viii. 40.)
and Ammianus Marcellinus (xxii. 15.), the Romans
first saw this animal in the celebrated edileship of
&AElig;milius Scaurus, 58 <span class="smcap lower">B.C.</span>, when a hippopotamus
and five crocodiles were exhibited at the games, in
a temporary canal. Dio Cassius, however, states
that Augustus C&aelig;sar first exhibited a rhinoceros
and a hippopotamus to the Roman people in the
year 29 <span class="smcap lower">B.C.</span> (li. 22.) Some crocodiles and hippopotami,
together with other exotic animals, were
afterwards exhibited in the games at Rome in the
time of Antoninus Pius (<span class="smcap lower">A.D.</span> 138-80. See Jul.
Capitolin. in <i>Anton. Pio</i>, c. 10.) and Commodus,
against his various exploits of animal warfare in the
amphitheatre, slew as many as five hippopotami
(<span class="smcap lower">A.D.</span> 180-92. See Dio Cass. lxxii. 10. and 19.;
and Gibbon, c. 4.). Firmus, an Egyptian pretender
to the empire in the time of Aurelian,
273 <span class="smcap lower">A.D.</span>, once rode on the back of a hippopotamus
(Flav. Vopiscus, in <i>Firmo</i>, c. 6.): but this feat was
probably performed at Alexandria.</p>

<p>The hippopotamus being an inhabitant of the
Upper Nile, was imperfectly known to the ancients.
Fabulous anecdotes of its habits are recounted by
Pliny, <i>H. N.</i>, viii. 39, 40., and by &AElig;lian, <i>De Nat.
An.</i>, v. 53. vii. 19. Achilles Tatius, who wrote as
late as the latter half of the fifth century of our
era, says that it breathes fire and smoke (iv. 2.);
while Damascius, who was nearly his contemporary
says that the hippopotamus is an unjust animal,
and represents Injustice in the hieroglyphic writing;
because it first kills its father and then violates its
mother (ap. Phot. <i>Bibl.</i> cod. 242., p. 322., b. 36.
ed. Bekker.).</p>

<p>Strabo (xv. 1.) and Arrian (<i>Ind.</i>, c. 6.) say that
the products of the Indian rivers are similar to
those of Ethiopia and Egypt, with the exception
of the hippopotamus. They add, however, that
according to Onesicritus, even this exception did
not exist: for that the hippopotamus was found
in the rivers of India. The report of Onesicritus
was doubtless erroneous.</p>

<p>Herodotus, Aristotle, and the other Greek writers constantly call
this animal
&#x1F35;&#x03C0;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03DB;&#x0020;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03AC;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03DB;. The
Latin writers use the improper compound <i>hippo-potamus</i>; which,
according to the ordinary rule of Greek composition, means, not
a <i>river-horse</i>, but a <i>horse-river</i>. The only Greek writer in
whom I have found the compound word
&#x1F31;&#x03C0;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03CC;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03DB; is Damascius,
who wrote in the sixth century. Achilles Tatius, who lived about the
same time, calls the animal
&#x1F35;&#x03C0;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03DB;&#x0020;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x0020;&#x039D;&#x03B5;&#x03AF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;
 which is, he
says, its Egyptian name. It seems probable that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>word <i>hippopotamus</i> is a Roman corruption of the Greek
substantive and adjective, and is not a proper Greek word. Why this
animal was called a horse is not evident. In shape and appearance it
resembles a gigantic hog. Buffon says that its name was derived from
its <i>neighing</i> like a horse (<i>Quad.</i>, tom. v., p. 165.). But
query whether this is the fact?</p>

<p>Bochart (<i>Hierozoicon</i>, P. ii., lib. v., c. 15, 16.)
identifies the "behemoth" of Job (c. 40.) with
the hippopotamus, and the "leviathan" with the
crocodile. This view seems to be generally adopted
by modern commentators. (See Winer, <i>Bibl.
Real-W&ouml;rterbuch</i>, art. "Nilpferd.")</p>

<p>A <i>Historia Hippopotami veterum Critica</i>, by
J. G. Schneider, is appended to his edition of
<i>Artedi Synonymia Piscium</i>, p. 247.</p>

<p>The accounts of the hippopotamus since the
revival of letters, beginning with that published by
Federigo Zerenghi, a Neapolitan surgeon, in 1603
(see Buffon), appear to have been all derived from
dead specimens, or from the reports of travellers

<h2><a name="FOLK_LORE" id="FOLK_LORE"></a>FOLK LORE.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Folk Lore of South Northamptonshire.</i></p>

<p><i>Charming.</i>&mdash;There are few villages in this district
which are not able to boast a professor of the
healing art, in the person of an old woman who
pretends to the power of curing diseases by "charming;"
and at the present day, in spite of coroners'
inquests and parish officers, a belief in the efficacy
of these remedies appears to be undiminished. Two
preliminaries are given, as necessary to be strictly
observed, in order to ensure a perfect cure. First,
that the person to be operated upon comes with a
full and earnest belief that a cure <i>will</i> be effected;
and, secondly, that the phrases "please" and
"thank you" do not occur during the transaction.
The established formula consists in the charmer's
crossing the part affected, and whispering over it
certain mysterious words&mdash;doubtless varied
according to the disorder, but the import of which I
have never been able to learn; for as there is a
very prevalent notion that, if once disclosed, they
would immediately lose their virtue, the possessors
are generally proof against persuasion or bribery.
In some cases it is customary for the charmer to
"bless" or hallow cords, or leathern thongs, which
are given to the invalids to be worn round the
neck. An old woman living at a village near
Brackley has acquired a more than ordinary renown
for the cure of agues by this means. According
to her own account, she received the
secret from the dying lips of her mother; who, in
her turn, is said to have received it from her's.
As this old dame is upwards of ninety, and still
refuses to part with her charm, the probability of
it perishing with her, forms a constant theme of
lamentation among her gossips. It must not be
imagined that these ignorant people make a trade
of their supposed art. On the contrary, it is believed
that any offer of pecuniary remuneration
would at once break the spell, and render the
charm of no avail; and though it must be admitted
that the influence and position naturally
accruing to the possessor of such attributes, affords
a sufficient motive for imposture, yet I think, for
the most part, they may be said to be the dupes
of their own credulity, and as fully convinced of
their own infallibility as can be the most credulous
of their admirers.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the more common
traditionary charms (used without having recourse
to the charmer) at present current among the rural
population of this district.</p>

<p><i>Warts.</i>&mdash;Take one of the large black snails,
which are to be found during summer in every
hedgerow, rub it over the wart, and then hang it
on a thorn. This must be done nine nights successively,
at the end of which times the wart will
completely disappear. For as the snail, exposed
to such cruel treatment, will gradually wither
away, so it is believed the wart, being impregnated
with its matter, will slowly do the same.</p>

<p><i>Wens.</i>&mdash;After a criminal is dead, but still
hanging, his hand must be rubbed thrice over the
wen. (Vide <i>Brand</i>, vol iii. p. 153.) Many persons
are still living who in their younger days have
undergone the ceremony, always, they say, attended
with complete success. On execution days at
Northampton, numbers of sufferers used to congregate
round the gallows, in order to receive the
"dead-stroke," as it is termed. At the last execution
which took place in that town, a very few
only were operated upon, not so much in consequence
of decrease of faith, as from the higher fee
demanded by the hangman.</p>

<p><i>Epistaxis.</i>&mdash;For stopping or preventing bleeding
at the nose, a toad is killed by transfixing it
with some sharp pointed instrument, after which
it is inclosed in a little bag and suspended round
the neck. The same charm is also occasionally
used in cases of fever. The following passage
From Sir K. Digby's <i>Discourse on Sympathy</i>
(Lond. 1658) may enlighten us as to the principle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In time of common contagion, they use to carry
about them the powder of a toad, and sometimes a
living toad or spider shut up in a box; or else they
carry arsnick, or some other venemous substance, which
<i>draws unto it the contagious air</i>, which otherwise would
infect the party." p. 77.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Another for the Same.</i>&mdash;If it be a man who
suffers, he asks a female to buy him a lace, (if a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>female she asks a man), without either giving money,
saying what it is wanted for, or returning thanks
when received. The lace so obtained must be
worn round the neck for the space of nine days;
at the expiration of which, it is said, the patient
will experience no return of the disorder.</p>

<p><i>Cramp.</i>&mdash;We still retain such a high sense of
the efficacy of the form of the cross, that in case of
spasms, or that painful state of the feet in which
they are said to "sleep," it is commonly used,
under the impression that it mitigates, if not entirely
allays, the pain. Warts are also charmed
away by crossing them with elder sticks: and a
very common charm for the cramp consists in the
sufferer's always taking care, when he pulls off his
shoes and stockings, to place them in such a position
as to form a resemblance to the "holy sign."</p>

<p>Another and very common charm resorted to for
the cure of this painful disorder, consists in the
wearing about the person the patella of a sheep or
lamb, here known as the "cramp-bone." This is
worn as near the skin as possible, and at night is
laid under the pillow. One instance of a <i>human</i>
patella being thus used has come under my notice,
but I believe this to be by no means common.</p>

<p><i>Toothache.</i>&mdash;Few ailments have more charms
for its cure than this. In point of efficacy none
are reckoned better than a tooth taken from the
mouth of a corpse, which is often enveloped in a
little bag, and hung round the neck. A double
nut is also sometimes worn in the pocket for the
same purpose.</p>

<p><i>Hooping-cough.</i>&mdash;A small quantity of hair is
taken frown the nape of the child's neck, rolled up
in a piece of meat, and given to a dog, in the firm
belief that the disease thereby becomes transferred
to the animal. A friend informs me that the same
charm is well known in Gloucestershire.</p>

<p><i>Rheumatism.</i>&mdash;The right forefoot of a hare, worn
constantly in the pocket, is considered a fine amulet
against the "rheumatiz."</p>

<p><i>West.</i>&mdash;In order to be rid of the painful tumour
on the eyelid, provincially known as the <i>west</i> or
<i>sty</i>, it is customary for the sufferer, on the first
night of the new moon, to procure the tail of a
black cat, and after pulling from it one hair, rub
the tip <i>nine</i> times over the pustule. As this has a
very cabalistic look, and is moreover frequently
attended with sundry severe scratches, a gold ring
is found to be a much more harmless substitute;
and as it is said to be equally beneficial with the
former, it is now more commonly used. This
superstition is alluded to by Beaumont and
Fletcher, <i>Mad Lovers</i>, v. 4.:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"&mdash;&mdash; I have a <i>sty</i> here, Chilax.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Chi.</i> I have no gold to cure it, not a penny."<br />
</p>

<p><i>Thorn.</i>&mdash;The following word charm is used to
prevent a thorn from festering:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our Saviour was of a virgin born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head was crowned with a crown of thorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It never canker'd nor fester'd at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I hope in Christ Jesus this never shaull [shall]."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This will remind the reader of the one given by

<h3><a name="BRASICHELLEN_AND_SERPILIUS_EXPURGATORY"
       id="BRASICHELLEN_AND_SERPILIUS_EXPURGATORY"></a>BRASICHELLEN AND
       SERPILIUS&mdash;EXPURGATORY INDEX.</h3>

<p>I have a note, and should be glad to put a
query, on the subject of a small octavo volume,
of which the title is, "Indicis Librorum Expurgandorum,
in studiosorum gratiam confecti,
tomus primus; in quo quinquaginta auctorum
libri pr&aelig; c&aelig;teris desiderati emendantur. Per Fr.
Io. Mariam Brasichellensem, sacri Palatii Apostolici
Magistrum, in unum corpus redactus, et public&aelig;
commoditati editus. Superiorum permissu, Rom&aelig;,
1607." Speaking of this index, Mendham says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"We now advance to perhaps the most extraordinary
and scarcest of all this class of publications. It is the
first, and last, and incomplete Expurgatory Index, which
Rome herself has ventured to present to the world, and
which, soon after the deed was done, she condemned
and withdrew.... After a selection of some of the
rules in the last edition of the Expurgatory Index, the
editor in his address informs the reader, that, understanding
the expurgation of books to be not the least
important part of his office, and wishing to make books
more accessible to students than they were without expurgation,
he had availed himself of the labours of his
predecessors, and, adding his own, issued the present
volume, intending that a second, which was in
great readiness, should quickly follow; (but, alas! it
was not allowed so to do). Dated Rome, from the
Apostolic Palace, 1607.... Nothing more remains
on the subject of this Index, than to report what is
contained in the inaccessible work of Zobelius, <i>Notitia
Indicis</i>, &amp;c., but repeated from by Struvius or Ingler, his
editor, in the <i>Bibliotheca Hist. Lit.</i>&mdash;that Brasichellen
or Guanzellus was assisted in the work by Thomas
Malvenda, a Dominican; that another edition was
printed at Bergomi in 1608; that when a fresh one
was in preparation at Antwerp in 1612, it was suppressed;
and that, finally, the author, like Montanus,
found his place in a future index."</p></blockquote>

<p>The second volume promised never appeared.
The work, however, became exceedingly scarce;
which induced Serpilius, a priest of Ratisbon, in
1723, to print an edition so closely resembling the
original, as to admit of its being represented as the
same. The imposition, however, being detected,
another edition was prepared by Hesselius, a
printer of Altorf, in 1745; and then the remaining
copies of the former threw off their mask, and
appeared with a new title-page as a second edition.
The original and counterfeit editions of this peculiar
work are sufficiently alike to deceive any
person, who should not examine them in literal
juxtaposition; but upon such examination, the deception
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>is easily apparent. The one, however,
may be fairly considered as a fac-simile of the
other. (See the Rev. Joseph Mendham's <i>Literary
Policy of the Church of Rome exhibited</i>, &amp;c., chap.
iii. pp. 116-128.) Mendham adds, that "there
is a copy of the original edition" of this index "in
the Bodleian Library, Oxford," presented to Sir
Thomas Bodley by the Earl of Essex, together
with the Belgic, Portuguese, Spanish and Neapolitan
Indices, all which originally belonged to the
library of Jerom Osorius, but had become part of
the spoil of the expedition against Cadiz in 1596.
I am acquainted with the Bodleian copy of the
original edition of this rare work; but I wish to
put the Query&mdash;Where is a copy of the <i>counterfeit
edition</i> of Serpilius to be seen, either with its
original title-page, or as it appeared afterwards,
when the mask was thrown off? I am not aware
that any one of our public libraries (rich as several
of them are in such treasures) contains a copy of
this curious little impostor.</p>

<h2><a name="Queries" id="Queries"></a>Queries</h2>

<h3><a name="SIR_GEORGE_BUC" id="SIR_GEORGE_BUC"></a>SIR GEORGE BUC.</h3>

<p>Can any of your readers inform me on what
authority Sir George Buc, the poet, and Master of
the Revels in the reign of James I., is recorded by
his biographers to have been a native of Lincolnshire,
and to have died in 1623? In the <i>Biogr.
Britann.</i>, and repeated by Chalmers, it is stated
that he was born in Lincolnshire, in the sixteenth
century, descended from the Bucs, or Buckes, of
West Stanton and Herthill, in Yorkshire, and
Melford Hall, in Suffolk, and knighted by James I.
the day before his coronation, July 13, 1603. Mr.
Collier, in his <i>Annals of the Stage</i>, vol. i., p. 374,
says, that on the death of Edmund Tylney, in
October, 1610, he succeeded him as Master of the
Revels, and wrote his Treatise on the Office of the
Revels prior to 1615. He also says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the spring of 1622, Sir George Buc appears to
have been so ill and infirm, as to be unable to discharge
the duties of his situation, and on the 2nd of May in
that year, a patent was made out, appointing Sir John
Astley Master of the Revels."&mdash;<i>Biogr. Britann.</i>, p. 419.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ritson says that he died in 1623. Chalmers
supposed his death to have happened soon after
1622, and states that he certainly died before
August 1629.</p>

<p>My reason for making these inquiries is, that I
have in my possession a 4to. manuscript volume,
believed to be in the handwriting of this Sir
George Buc, which is quite at variance with these
statements in several particulars. The volume
which is without a date in any part, and has only
the initials of the author, is entitled <i>The Famous
History of Saint George, England's brave Champion.
Translated into Verse, and enlarged. The
three first Chapters by G. B. His first Edition.</i>
It is extended to nineteen chapters, and comprehends
also the histories of the other six champions,
as well as that of St. George. It is contained in a
thick 4to. volume of 524 closely written pages, in
Russia, and was formerly in the collection of the
Duke of Roxburghe, whose arms are on the sides;
and afterwards in that of Mr. Heber. This MS.
is entirely in the handwriting of Sir George Buc,
as prepared by him for publication. The initials
"G. B." correspond with those of his name, and
the handwriting, having been compared, is found
to be exactly similar to a MS. inscription, in Sir
George Buc's handwriting, prefixed to a copy of
his poem
 &#x0394;&#x03B1;&#x03D5;&#x03BD;&#x1F76;&#x03DB;&#x0020;&#x03A0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03B4;&#x03C4;&#x03AD;&#x03D5;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03DB;
 4to., 1605, presented
by him to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, and
preserved at Bridgewater House; a fac-simile of
which is given by Mr. Collier in his privately
printed catalogue of that library, p. 41.</p>

<p>The volume commences with a sort of metrical
preface, entitled <i>The Muse's Apologie</i>, in which he
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Consider that my Muse is aged growne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pilgrimage to <i>seventy-six is knowne</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy nimble steps to <i>Norfolk</i> none forbeare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm confident thou shalt be welcom'd there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where that thy autor <i>hee was bred and borne</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though to Parnassus Girles was never sworne."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The work is dedicated "To the vertuous Lady
and his most honoured friend, the Lady Bacon, at
Readgrave Hall, in Suffolk, wife to S<sup>r</sup> Edmond
Bacon, Prime Baronett of England," commencing
thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Faire madam,&mdash;Having nothing at present, I
thought was fitt (<i>living at so far distance</i>) to present
to y<sup>r</sup> ladyship," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>The distance here alluded to was probably
caused by the author's residence in London at that
time. This is followed by some lines "To the
Courteous Reader," beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some certaine Gentlemen did mee ingage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To publish forth this work, done in myne age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this, my aged act, it may survive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My funerall and keep me still alive."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and by others, entitled "The Autor," signed
"Vale, G. B.;" after which are added the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some Poets they are poore, and so am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Except I bee reliev'd in Chancery</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scorne to begg, my pen nere us'd the trade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This book to please my friends is only made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is performed by my aged quill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to extend my country my good will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not my country think I took this paynes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In expectation of any gaines."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We know from Mr. Collier's Bridgewater Catalogue,
that Sir George Buc had been indebted to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Lord Ellesmere for certain favours shown him,
probably in some Chancery suit, to which he here
seems to allude, as if still suffering in his pocket
from its ill consequences.</p>

<p>My first quotation from the poem itself is one of
some importance, as serving to show the probable
time at which it was written. On the reverse of
fol. 9., at the commencement of the poem, an allusion
is thus made to the destruction of Troy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And wasted all the buildings of the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which unto Priamus did glory bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destroy'd his pallaces, the cittie graces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the lusters of his royall places,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Just as Noll Cromewell in this iland did,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For his reward at Tiburne buried.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So also, again, on the reverse of fol. 11., in reference
to the abuses and profanations committed
by Cromwell's soldiery in St. Paul's Cathedral, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pittie it were this faberick should fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into decay, derives its name from Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But yet of late it suffered vile abuses,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Was made a stable for all traytors' uses</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had better burnt it down for an example,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Herostratus did Diana's temple."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And again, at the commencement of the eighth
chapter, fol. 104.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In this discourse, my Muse doth here intend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The honor of Saint Patrick to defend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speake of his adventrous accidents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his brave fortunes, and their brave events,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if her pen were made of <i>Cromwell's rump</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet she should weare it to the very stump."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the end of the poem he again alludes to his
great age, and to the time which had been occupied
in writing it, and also promised, if his life should
be prolonged, a second part, in continuation,
which, however, appears never to have been
accomplished:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My Muse wants eloquence and retoricke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to describe it more scollerlike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doth crave pardon for hir bold adventure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that upon these subjects she did enter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis eight months since this first booke was begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Muse, breake off, high time 'tis to adone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Travell no further in these martiall straines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we know what will please us for our paines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know thy will is forward to performe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What age doth now deny thy quill t' adorne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose age is <i>seventy-sixe, compleat in yeares</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in the Regester at large appeares."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Cromwell died Sept. 3. 1658, and was interred
in Westminster Abbey; but his bones were not
removed and buried at Tyburn till the 30th of
January, 1660; very soon after which it is most
probable that this poem was written. Now if the
author was, as he says, seventy-six at this time, he
must have been born about 1583 or 1584, which
will rightly correspond with the account given by
Chalmers and others; and thus he would be about
twenty-two or twenty-three years of age when he
wrote his first poem of &#x0394;&#x03B1;&#x03D5;&#x03BD;&#x1F76;&#x03DB;&#x0020;&#x03A0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03B4;&#x03C4;&#x03AD;&#x03D5;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03DB;,
twenty-seven when he succeeded to the office of
Master of the Revels. There appears to be no
reason for supposing, with Ritson, that <i>The Great
Plantagenet</i>, which was the second edition of that
poem, and published in 1635, was done "by some
fellow who assumed his name;" but that the variations,
which are very considerable, were made by
the author himself, and printed in his lifetime.
The Dedication to Sir John Finch, Lord Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas, signed "George
Buck," and written exactly in his style; the three
sets of commendatory verses addressed to the
author by O. Rourke, Robert Codrington, and
George Bradley, not in the first edition of the
poem "Upon King Henrie the Second, the first
Plantagenet of England," &amp;c., added to this impression;
all tend to show that the author was then
living in 1635. We learn by the above quotations
from his MS. poem, that his days were further
prolonged till 1660.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your numerous readers may be
able to discover some corroborative proofs of this
statement from other sources, and will be kind
enough to favour me, through your paper, with any
evidence which may occur to then, bearing upon
the subject of my inquiries.</p>

<h3><a name="COSAS_DE_ESPANA" id="COSAS_DE_ESPANA"></a>COSAS DE ESPA&Ntilde;A.</h3>

<p>The things of Spain are peculiar to a proverb,
but they are not so exclusively national but we
may find some connection with them in things of
our own country. Any information from readers
of <span class="smcap">Notes and Queries</span>, on a few Spanish things
which I have long sought for in vain, would prove
most acceptable and useful to me.</p>

<p>1. In <i>Catalogi Librorum Manuscriptorum, Angli&aelig;
et Hiberni&aelig;</i>, &amp;c., under "Library of Westminster
Abbey," at p. 29., I find mentioned the
following MS.: <i>Una Resposal del Reverend Padre
Thomaso Cranmero</i>. It is not now in that library&mdash;is
it in any other? I suppose it may be a
translation, made by Francisco Dryander or Enzinas,
translator of the Spanish New Testament,
1543, of&mdash;"An Answer by the Right Rev. Father
in God, Thomas, Abp. of Canterbury, unto a crafty
and sophistical cavillation devised by Stephen
Gardener," &amp;c. Dryander came to this country with
Bucer, recommended to Cranmer by Melancthon,
and resided two months in the Archbishop's house
before he went to Cambridge to lecture in Greek.</p>

<p>2. Ferdinando de Tereda, a Spanish Protestant,
came to this country in 1620. The Lord Keeper
Williams took him into his house to learn Spanish
of him, in order to treat personally with the
Spanish ambassador about the marriage of Prince
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>Charles and the Infanta. At this instance,
Tereda translated the English Liturgy into Spanish
(1623), and was repaid by presentation to a
prebend at Hereford. On the death of James, in
1625, he left, as he says, the Court, before the
Court left him, and retired to Hereford. Here he
adds: "I composed a large volume <i>De Monachatu</i>,
in Latin; another <i>De Contradictionibus Doctrin&aelig;
Ecclesi&aelig; Roman&aelig;</i>, in the same language; and a
third, entitled <i>Carrascon</i>, also in Latin." In 1631-2
he vacated his prebend, and went, I conjecture, to
Holland, where he printed <i>Carrascon</i> in <i>Spanish</i>
(1633), being a selection from the Latin. In the
preface to this, which recently had been reprinted,
he proposed to print the other works which he had
prepared, if the Spanish <i>Carrascon</i> brought him
"good news." Do his Latin works exist either in
print or in manuscript?</p>

<p>3. Juan de Nicholas y Sacharles was another
Spanish Protestant, who came to this country in
1618. He translated the <i>Bouclier de la Foi</i>, by
P. Moulin, into Spanish; he presented it, I conjecture
in MS., to Prince Charles about the year
1620. Is such a MS. known to exist in any of our
libraries?</p>

<p>4. The recent <i>History of Spanish Literature</i>, by
George Ticknor, has made us generally acquainted,
that the author of the clever "Dialogo de las Lenguas,"
printed in <i>Origines de la Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola</i>
by Gregorio Mayans y Siscar, was Juan de Valdes,
to whom Italy and Spain herself owed the
dawning light of the religious reformation which
those countries received. Spaniards well informed
in their own literature have of course been long
aware of the authorship of the "Dialogo de las
Lenguas." But few even of them are aware that
Mayans y Siscar could not, even at so late a period,
venture to reprint the work, as it was written by
Juan de Valdes. He suppressed various passages,
for the Inquisition was in his day too jealous and
powerful for him to risk offence. Notwithstanding,
and as <i>una cosa de Espa&ntilde;a</i>, he printed a few copies
privately, entire. Expurgated books are always
unsatisfactory mutilations. Does any <i>Manuscript</i>
of the "Dialogo de las Lenguas" exist in this
country, in any public or private library?</p>

<h3><a name="CARTERS_DRAWINGS_OF_YORK_CATHEDRAL_MEDAL_OF_STUKELEY" id="CARTERS_DRAWINGS_OF_YORK_CATHEDRAL_MEDAL_OF_STUKELEY"></a>CARTER'S DRAWINGS OF YORK CATHEDRAL.&mdash;MEDAL OF STUKELEY.</h3>

<p>I shall be glad to ascertain, if possible, through
the medium of your columns, who is now the
possessor of a volume of elaborate <i>Drawings of
York Cathedral</i>, which were made by the late John
Carter, F. S. A., for Sir Mark M. Sykes, Bart.
Mr. Carter was paid a large sum on account of
these drawings during the progress of his task, but
after the death of the baronet, he demanded such
an extravagant price that the executors declined
to take the volume. At the sale of the artist's
effects it was sold to Sir Gregory Page Turner,
Bart., for 315<i>l.</i> It again came to the hammer,
and was purchased by John Broadley, Esq., at
whose sale it was disposed of for 100<i>l.</i> I cannot
ascertain the purchaser on the last occasion, and
am very desirous to learn where the drawings are
now to be found.</p>

<p>The same artist also prepared a series of drawings
illustrative of English costume from the
earliest period. This volume was executed for
Thomas Lister Parker, Esq., but, like the former,
has passed into the custody of other persons, and
I am now ignorant of its possessor.</p>

<p>I have not yet received any reply to my inquiry
in Vol. i. p. 122., respecting a large bronze medal
of Dr. Stukeley, with a view of Stonehenge on the
reverse, evidently executed soon after his decease.
I believe it to be unique, but should be glad to
know if dies were ever engraved from this design.</p>

<p><i>"Imprest" and "Debenture."</i>&mdash;When a person
fulfilling any employment under any of the Government
Boards has occasion to draw "money on
account," an "imprest," addressed to the pay-master
under that Board, is issued for the required
sum; but when the final payment is made upon
the "closing of the account," the "debenture"
takes the place of the "imprest." Out of what
verbal raw material are these words manufactured?
I know of no other use of the word "imprest" as
a substantive; and though we see "debenture"
often enough in railway reports, I cannot perceive
the analogy between its meanings in the two cases.</p>

<p><i>Cosin's MSS.</i>&mdash;Basire, in his <i>Brief of the Life,
&amp;c. of Bishop Cosin</i>, appended to his <i>Funeral
Sermon</i> (Lond. 1673, p. 69.), after noticing
several MS. works of Cosin's, some of which have
not yet seen the light, adds, "These remains are
earnestly recommended to his pious executor's
care for publication."</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents kindly inform
me, who are the lineal representatives of Cosin's
pious executor? Basire mentions three "imperfect"
works of Bishop Cosin's in manuscript: viz.
<i>Annales Eccles.</i>, <i>Historia Conciliorum</i>, <i>Chronologia
Sacra</i>. Is it known what has become of
them? They appear to have fallen, with other
MSS., into the hands of his executor.</p>

<p><i>Clergy sold for Slaves.</i>&mdash;Walker, in his <i>Sufferings
of the Clergy</i>, says, "There was a project
on foot to sell some of the most eminent" (of the
masters of colleges, doctors in divinity, &amp;c.) "to
the Turks for slaves; and a considerable progress
was made in that horrid purpose." And, writing
of Dr. Ed. Layfield, under the head of "London
Cathedrals," Walker again says, that "at last, in
the company of others, he was clapt on shipboard
under hatches;" and that "they were threatened
to be sold slaves to the Algerines, or to some of
our own plantations." Again, it is recorded in
Bishop Cosin's life, that by his will "he gave
towards the redemption of Christian captives at
Algiers, 500<i>l.</i>; towards the relief of the distressed
loyal party in England, 800<i>l.</i>:"&mdash;upon which I
should be glad to put a Query; viz., Is there
sufficient ground for supposing, that any of the
loyal party were really sold for slaves during the
rebellion? If otherwise, will Cosin's bequest throw
any light upon R. W. B.'s Query, vol. i., p. 441.?</p>

<h3><a name="ASINORUM_SEPULTURA" id="ASINORUM_SEPULTURA"></a>ASINORUM SEPULTURA.</h3>

<p>To discover the origin of this phrase, your correspondent
(Vol. ii., p. 8-9.) need not go further
than to his Bible.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sepultura asini sepelietur, putrefactus et projectus
extra portas Jerusalem."&mdash;<i>Jerem.</i> xxii. 19.: cf. xxxvi. 30.</p></blockquote>

<p>With regard to the extract given by Ducange,
at the word "Imblocatus," from a "vetus formula
Excommunicationis pr&aelig;clara," it is evident that
the expressions,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sint cadavera eorum in escam volatilibus c&#339;li, et
bestiis terr&aelig;, et non sint qui sepeliant eos,"</p></blockquote>

<p>have been derived from S. Jerome's Latin version
from the Hebrew of Psal. lxxix. 2, 3.:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dederunt cadavera servorum tuorum escam volatilibus
c&#339;li; carnes sanctorum tuorum bestiis terr&aelig;.
Effuderunt sanguinem eorum quasi aquam in circuitu
Hierusalem, et non erat qui sepeliret."&mdash;Vide Jacobi
Fabri Stapulensis <i>Quincuplex Psalterium</i>, fol. 116. b.,
Paris, 1513; Sabatier, tom. ii. p. 162. Ib. 1751.</p></blockquote>

<p class="author">R. G.</p>

<p>The use of this term in the denunciation against
Jehoiakim, more than six centuries <span class="smcap lower">B.C.</span>, and the
previous enumeration of crimes in the 22nd chapter
of Jeremiah, would seem sufficiently to account
for its origin and use in regard to the disposal of
the dead bodies of excommunicated or notorious
malefactors, by the earliest Christian writers or
judges. The Hebrew name of the ass, says Parkhurst,
is "derived from its turbulence when excited
by lust or rage;" and the animal was also made
the symbol of slothful or inglorious ease, in the
case of Issachar, <span class="smcap lower">B.C.</span> 1609: Genesis, xlix. 14. It
is thus probable some reference to such characteristics
of the brute and the criminal, rather than
any mere general allusion to throwing the dead
bodies of inferior or unclean animals (of which the
dog was a more common type) under any rubbish
beyond the precincts of the city, may have been
intended, by specifying this animal in prescribing
an ignominious sepulture.</p>

<p class="author smcap">Lamba.</p>

<p>It can hardly have escaped the notice of your
Querist (although the instance is not one adduced
by Ducange), that the phrase, "burial of an ass"
&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1463;&#1514; &#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512; for "no burial at all," is as
old as the time of the prophet Jeremiah. (Vide
chap. xxii. 19.) The <i>custom</i> referred to being of
religious origin, might lead us to the sacred books
for the origin of the <i>phrase</i> denoting it; and it
seems natural for the Christian writers, in any
mention of those whose bodies, like that of Jehoiakim,
were for their sins deprived of the rites of
sepulture, to use the striking phrase already provided
for them in Scripture; and as natural for
that phrase to continue in use even after the somewhat
more civilised custom of "imblocation" had
deprived it of its original reference to "the dead
body's being cast out in the day to the heat, and
in the night to the frost." (Jer. xxxvi. 30.)</p>

<p class="author smcap">J. Eastwood.</p>

<p>This phrase is, I think, accounted for by the ass
being deprived of interment in consequence of the
uses made of its dead carcass. After a description
of the adaptation of his bones to instrumental
music, Aldrovandus continues as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></div>

<h3><a name="POPE_FELIX" id="POPE_FELIX"></a>POPE FELIX.</h3>

<p>Four Popes of the name have filled the chair of
St. Peter.</p>

<p>The first suffered martyrdom under Aurelian.
He is honoured with a festival at Rome on the 29th
May.</p>

<p>The second also received the crown of martyrdom,
under Constantine. His festival is kept on
the 29th July.</p>

<p>The third is commemorated as a holy confessor
on the 25th February. He was a collateral ancestor
of Pope St. Gregory the Great, who mentions
him in his writings.</p>

<p>Gregory had three aunts by the father's side,
who all became nuns. One of them, Tarsilla, a
lady of pious and beatified life, and of very advanced
age, had one night a vision of Pope Felix,
who was then dead. He seemed to point towards
the mansions of eternal glory, and to invite her to
enter. She soon after sickened, and her end
visibly approached. While a number of her friends
were standing around her couch, she suddenly exclaimed,
looking upwards, "Stand aside, stand
aside, Jesus is coming;" and with a look of ineffable
love, she presently expired. This story is
related by St. Gregory.</p>

<p>This Pope is the best known of the four on account
of his relationship to St. Gregory.</p>

<p>The fourth of the name was also a confessor.
His festival occurs on the 30th January.</p>

<p>I beg to offer the following remarks in reply
to the numismatic queries of E. S. T. (Vol. i.,
p. 468.):&mdash;</p>

<p>1. I can only account for the Macedonian coin
being struck in lead, by supposing it to be the
work of an ancient forger.</p>

<p>2. Third brass coins of Tiberius are not uncommon;
I have one in my cabinet of the sort

DIVI. AVG. F. AVGVSTVS</span>; Rev. the altar of Lyons,
<span class="lower smcap">ROM. ET. AVG.</span></p>

<p>3. The coin of Herennia Etruscilla is probably
a base or plated denarius, the silver having been
worn off. Silver coins sometimes acquire a black
tarnish, so that they are not to be distinguished
from brass without filing the edge, or steeping
them in acid. If a genuine brass coin, it should
have the S. C. for <i>Senatus Consultum</i>.</p>

<p>4. The coin of Macrinus was struck at Antioch
in Syria, of which famous city there exists a regular
series of imperial coins from Augustus to
Valerian. One in my possession has &#x0394; above the

<h3><a name="AS_LAZY_AS_LUDLUMS_DOG" id="AS_LAZY_AS_LUDLUMS_DOG"></a>AS LAZY AS LUDLUM'S DOG.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. i., p. 382.)</p>

<p>I feel obliged by the extract from the <i>Doctor</i>
given by J. M. B. (Vol. i., p. 475.), though it only
answers by a kind of implication the Query I proposed.
That implication is, that, instead of Ludlum
and his dog being personages of distinction in
their own way and in their own day, the proverb
itself is merely one framed on the principle of
alliteration, and without precise or definite "meaning."
This is very full of meaning, as anyone
may convince himself by observing the active
energy of every muscle of all dogs in the act of
barking. What can typify "laziness" more emphatically
than a dog that "lays him[self] down
to bark?"</p>

<p>A <i>jingle</i> of some kind is essential to a proverb.
If a phrase or expression have not this, it never
"takes" with the masses; whilst, having this, and
being capable of any possible and common application,
it is sure to live, either as a proverb or a
"saw," as the case may be. Alliteration and
rhyme are amongst the most frequent of these
"jingles;" and occasionally a "pun" supplies
their place very effectively. We find these conditions
fulfilled in the proverbs and saws of every
people in the eastern and western world, alike in
the remotest antiquity and in our own time. But
are they therefore "without meaning?" Do not
these qualities help to give them meaning, as well
as to preserve them through their long and varied
existence?</p>

<p>But there is another principle equally essential
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>to the constitution of a legitimate and lasting proverb;
or rather two conjointly, <i>metre</i> and <i>euphony</i>.
These may be traced in the proverb as completely
as in the ballad; and precisely the same contrivances
are employed to effect them in both cases
where any ruggedness in the natural collocation
of the words may present itself. For instance,
change in the accent, the elision or the addition of
a letter or syllable, the lengthening of a vowel,
transposition, and a hundred other little artifices.
The euphony itself, though sometimes a little imperfect,
is also studied with the same kind of care
in the older and purer proverbs of all languages.</p>

<p>Attention to metre and euphony will generally
enable us to assign, amongst the forms in which
we pick up and note any particular proverb, the
original and legitimate one; especially when combined
with brevity and "pith." As a case in
point, our friend Ludlum will serve our purpose
for comparison. Who does not see at a glance,
taking account of the principles which govern the
construction of a proverb, that the Sheffield version,
as I gave it, <i>must be</i> more genuine than
Southey's version, quoted by J. M. B.? Besides
this, I may add, that a friend, whose early days
were spent in Sheffield, has told, me (since the
Query was proposed) that he has heard his mother
tell some legend of "the fat Miss Ludlum." After
all, therefore, the proverb may be founded on a
fat old maid and her fat poodle. I can hardly,
then, deem my inquiry answered.</p>

<p>J. M. B. quotes two others from the <i>Doctor</i>;
one for the purpose, as would appear by his marking
the words, to illustrate the alliterative principle.
The following are variations which I have
heard:&mdash;"As proud as the cobbler's dog, that
took [or <i>as</i> took&mdash;the most general vernacular
form, for the sake of euphony] the wall of a dung-cart,
and got crushed for his pains." "As queer
as Dick's hatband as went nine times round and
wouldn't tie."</p>

<p>On these I will only remark, that few persons
would pronounce dung-cart as J. M. B. implies,
even for alliteration; and, indeed, when so even
marked to the eye, it is not without an effort that
we can read accordingly. As to Dick's hatband,
it is expressed in a peculiarly clumsy and round-about
manner by Southey.</p>

<p>One word more. J. M. B. quotes as a <i>proverb</i>&mdash;one
of those without meaning&mdash;"As busy as
Batty;" and says, "no one knows who Batty was."
Surely, the inference that Batty was not a real
personage in some distant age&mdash;that he was a
mere myth&mdash;must be a <i>non sequitur</i> from the premises
before us. Perhaps Mr. Batty was a person
of notable industry&mdash;perhaps remarkable for always
beings in a "fluster"&mdash;perhaps the rural Paul
Pry of his day and district. He has left, too, a
large progeny; whether as regards the name alone,
or whichever of the characters he bore.</p>

<p>This jingle upon words partakes largely of the
character of the <i>pun</i>. It, however, reminds me of
a mode of speech which universally prevailed in
the north of Lincolnshire thirty years ago, and
which probably does so yet. A specimen will explain
the whole:&mdash;"I'm as throng as throng."
"He looks as black as black." "It's as wet as
wet." I have heard this mode used so as to produce
considerable emphasis; and it is more than
possible, that some of the jingles have thus originated,
and settled into proverbs, now without any
obvious meaning, but originally very forcible
ones.</p>

<p><i>When Easter ends.</i>&mdash;Mr. H. Edwards, in this
day's number (No. 31., p. 9.), asks when Easter ends.
I fancy this question is in some degree answered
by remarking, that it, together with other festivals
of the Church, viz. The Nativity, &amp;c., are celebrated
for eight days, which is the octave. The
reason, says Wheatley, of its</p>

<blockquote><p>"Being fixed to eight days, is taken from the practice
of the Jews, who, by God's appointment, observed
the greater festivals, some of them for seven days, and
one, the Feast of Tabernacles, for eight days. And
therefore the Primitive Christians lengthened out their
higher feast to eight days."</p></blockquote>

<p>If this be true, Easter will end on the conclusion
of the Sunday after Easter day; but whether our
present Parliament is sufficiently Catholic to admit
this, in the interpretation of the Act, is questionable.</p>

<p>In the Spanish Church Easter continues till the
feast of Whitsuntide is past; and during this
period all fasts are forbidden.</p>

<p>The Romish Church has ten high festivals having
octaves.</p>

<p>I trust this slight sketch may in some way help
Mr. Edwards to a conclusion.</p>

<p><i>Holdsworth and Fuller.</i>&mdash;In A. B. R.'s communication
(Vol. i., p. 484.) some symptoms of inaccuracy
must be noted before a satisfactory reply
can be given to his Query.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></div>
<p>1. He has erred in adopting the spelling of
Holdsworth's name (viz. Holsworth) which appears
in the title-page of <i>The Valley of Vision</i>.
2. This work is very incorrectly styled "the sermon,"
inasmuch as it consists of twenty-one
sermons. 3. My copy bears date 1661, not 1651.
4. If Holdsworth's hand was "legible only to himself,"
we may sincerely commiserate the misfortune
of his nephew, Dr. Richard Pearson, who
had to prepare for the press 737 folio pages of
his <i>Pr&aelig;lectiones Theologic&aelig;</i>, &amp;c.: Lond. 1661.
5. There is not the smallest reason for thinking
it "probable" that Dean Holdsworth "preached
other men's sermons." Respecting our great
Caroline divines it would seldom have been right
to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quos (Harpyiarum more)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convectare juvat pr&aelig;das, et vivere rapto."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, as to what Dr. Holdsworth really wrote,
and with regard to that for which he is not responsible,
it is to be observed, that he was so
averse to the publication of any of his works, that
he printed but a single sermon (on Psalm cxliv.
15.), and that not until he had been three times
urged to the task by his royal master King
Charles I. The pagination of this discourse is
quite distinct from that of the twenty unauthentic
sermons which follow it in the quarto volume, and
which commence at signature <span class="smcap">B</span>. These are thus
described by Dr. Pearson, <i>ad Lectorem</i>: "C&aelig;ter&aelig;
qu&aelig; prostant Anglic&egrave; venales, &agrave; pr&aelig;done illo
stenographico tam lacer&aelig; et elumbes, tam miser&egrave;

<p><i>Gookin</i> (Vol. i., pp. 385, 473, 492.).&mdash;Vincent
Gookin was nominated by Cromwell one of the
six representatives of Ireland in the Barebones
Parliament; and he was returned for Bandon and
Kinsale (which together sent one member) in
each of the three subsequent Cromwellian Parliaments.</p>

<p>Lord Orrery, writing to the Duke of Ormond,
June 15, 1666, speaks of Captain Robert Gooking,
as one of the chief persons in the west of Cork
county, and describes him as rich and having good
brains, loyal, and ready to fight against French or
Irish, as every thing he has depends on his new
title. (Orrery's <i>State Letters</i>, ii. p. 13. Dublin
edition.) A little further on (p. 43.), Lord
Orrery names the same Robert Gooking as recommended
by the chief gentlemen in the west
of Cork to be captain of a troop of horse in the
militia.</p>

<p>"<i>Brozier</i>" (Vol. i., p. 485.), "<i>Sock</i>," "<i>Tick.</i>"&mdash;I
well remember the phrase, "brozier my dame," signifying
to "eat her out of house and home." I had
forgotten that a boy at Eton was "brozier,"
when he had spent all his pocket-money. As a
supplemental note, however, to Lord Braybrooke's
remarks upon this latter signification, I would remind
old Etonians of a request that would sometimes
slip out from one in a "broziered" state,
viz. that a schoolfellow would <i>sock</i> him, <i>i.e.</i> treat
him to <i>sock</i> at the pastrycook's; and this favour
was not unfrequently granted <i>on tick, i.e.</i> on credit
with the purveyor of sweets.</p>

<p>In reply to your noble correspondent's Query,
I beg to say that Halliwell, in his <i>Dictionary of
Archaic and Provincial Words</i>, both spells and defines
thus: "Brosier. A bankrupt. <i>Chesh.</i>" Mr.
H. says no more; but this seems to decide that the
word does not exclusively belong to Eton. I
could have fancied that on such classic ground it
might possibly have sprung from &#x03B2;&#x03C1;&#x03CE;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C9;, fut. -&#x03C3;&#x03C9;],
<i>to devour</i>.</p>

<p>Is <i>sock</i> only a corruption of <i>suck</i>, indicating a
lollipop origin? or what is its real etymological
root?</p>

<p>Richardson most satisfactorily says, that to "go
on <i>tick</i>" is to give a note or <i>ticket</i> instead of payment.</p>

<p class="author smcap">Alfred Gatty.</p>

<p>Ecclesfield, May 27. 1850.</p>

<p>This Eton phrase, the meaning of which is very
correctly explained <span class="smcap">Lord Braybrooke</span> (Vol. i.,
p. 485.), appears to be connected with the Cheshire
provincialism, which is thus interpreted in Wilbraham's
<i>Cheshire Glossary</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"'Brosier, <i>s.</i> a bankrupt.' It is often used by boys
at play, when one of them has nothing further to stake."</p></blockquote>

<p>The noun <i>brosier</i>, as Mr. Wilbraham indicates,
seems to be derived from the old word <i>brose</i>, or,
as we now say, <i>bruise</i>. A <i>brosier</i> would therefore
mean a broken-down man, and therefore a bankrupt.
The verb <i>to brosier</i>, as used at Eton, would
easily be formed from the substantive. In the
medi&aelig;val Latin, <i>ruptura</i> and <i>ruptus</i> were used to
signify <i>bankruptcy</i> and a <i>bankrupt</i>. See Duncange,
<i>Gloss.</i> in vv.</p>

<p class="author smcap">Etoniensis.</p>

<p>The word <i>brozier</i>, or (as I always heard it
pronounced) <i>brosier</i>, does not, or did not exclusively
belong to Eton. It was current at Hackney
School, an establishment formerly on the site of
the present Infant Orphan Asylum, and had the
precise meaning attributed to it by Lord Braybrooke.
It was used both as a verb and as a substantive,
but of its origin and etymology I am
ignorant. The last master of Hackney School
was the Rev. Dr. Heathcote, who died, I believe,
about 1820. The schoolhouse was a very large
and a very old building. May I take this opportunity
of asking if anything is known of its history?
There was a tradition prevalent among the
boys, that it had been an hospital in the time of
the Plague.</p>

<p>I recollect there was another singular word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>current at Hackney, viz. "buckhorse," for a smart
box on the ear.</p>

<p class="author">C. M.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Buckhorse was a celebrated bruiser, whose name
has been preserved in this designation of a blow, in
the same way as that of his successor "Belcher" has
been in that of the peculiar style of silk handkerchief
which he always wore.]</p></blockquote>


<p><i>Symbols of Four Evangelists.</i>&mdash;Among the
several replies to <span class="smcap">Jartzberg's</span> Query (Vol. i.,
p. 385.), I do not observe any notice of Sir T. Brown's
account of the symbols of the four Evangelists.
I will therefore copy part of a note I
have on the subject, though see it is unfortunately
without any other reference than the <i>name</i>
of the author.</p>

<p>After giving <i>Jonathan's</i> opinion of the four
principal or legionary standards among the Israelites,
Sir T. Brown adds:</p>

<blockquote><p>"But Abenegra and others, besides the colours of
the field, do set down other charges,&mdash;in Reuben's, the
form of a man or mandrake,&mdash;in that of Judah, a lion,&mdash;in
Ephraim's, an ox; in Dan's, the figure of an eagle.
And thus, indeed, the four figures in the banners of the
principal squadrons of Israel are answerable unto the
Church in the vision of Ezekiel, every one carrying
the form of all these.... And conformable hereunto,
the pictures of the Evangelists (whose Gospels
are the Christian banners) are set forth with the addition
of a man or angel, an ox, a lion, and an eagle.
And these symbolically represent the office of angels
and ministers of God's will, in whom is required, understanding
as in a man, courage and vivacity as in a
lion, service and ministerial officiousness as in the ox,
expedition or celerity of execution as in the eagle."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Catacombs and Bone-houses</i> (Vol. i. p. 171.).&mdash;Part
I. of a <i>History of the Hundred of Rowell</i> by
Paul Cypher (published by J. Ginns, Rowell,)
has recently fallen in my way, and as I understand
the writer is a medical gentleman residing
in the village (or town), I condense from the account
of the "Bone Caverns," p. 39-42., such
particulars as may answer the Query of Rev. A. Gatty.</p>

<p>The number of skeletons, as is asserted by those
who have taken the trouble to calculate, is 30,000.
The vault in which they are deposited is a long
cryptiform structure, with a low groined roof, and
the bones are carefully packed in alternate strata
of skulls, arms, legs, and so forth. They seem to
have been discovered by a gravedigger about 150
years since. Nothing is known with certainty
respecting the date of this vast collection. Some
conjecture that the remains here deposited are the
consequence of a sanguinary battle in very early
times, and profess to discover peculiarities in the
osseous structure, showing a large proportion of
the deceased to have been natives of a distant
land; that all were in the prime of life; and that
most of the skulls are fractured, as though with
deadly weapons. Others, again, say they are the
remains of the slain at Naseby.</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have examined carefully and at leisure the crania,
and can discover none but the mesobreginate skulls
common to these islands.... I have discovered more
than one skull, in which the alveolar sockets were entirely
absorbed,&mdash;an effect of age rarely produced under
eighty years, I should imagine. And as to the marks
of injury visible on some, they will be attributed, I
think, by the impartial observer, rather to the spade
and foot of the sexton, than the battle-axe and stout
arm of the ancient Briton."</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the supposition that these relics were
brought from Naseby, it is sufficient to observe
that the number of the slain in that engagement
did not exceed one thousand.</p>

<blockquote><p>"That most of these bodies were lying in the earth
for a number of years is proved, I think, by these several
circumstances: First, a careful examination of the interior
of many of the skulls, shows that roots have vegetated
within them, the dry fibres of which I have often
observed; next, the teeth are nearly all absent, and it
is notoriously one of the first effects of inhumation upon
the osseous system, by which the teeth are loosened;
and lastly, we have two sources from which bodies may
have been exhumed and reinterred beneath the mother
church; and those are the Chapel of the Virgin and that
moiety of the original graveyard, which has evidently
at some long distant time, been taken from the church."</p></blockquote>

<p>Human bones have been dug up in front of
Jesus Hospital, to the south-east of the church-yard.
At the eastern extremity of the cavern is
a rude sketch apparently intended to represent
the Resurrection.</p>

<p><i>Tace Latin for a Candle</i> (Vol. i., p. 385).&mdash;I
am not aware of "Tace is Latin for a candle"
in any earlier book than Swift's <i>Polite Conversation</i>;
but it must have been threadbare in his
time, or he would not have inserted it in that great
collection of platitudes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Lord Smart.</i> Well, but after all, Tom, can you tell
me what is Latin for a goose?</p>

<p>"<i>Neverout.</i> O, my Lord, I know that; why, Brandy
is Latin for a goose, and <i>Tace</i> is Latin for a candle."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Members for Durham&mdash;why none prior to</i>
1673-4 (Vol. ii., p. 8.).&mdash;Because Durham was an
episcopal palatine, which had jurisdictions, and
even, in olden times, a Parliament of its own.
Several bills were brought in between 1562 and
1673, to give M.P.'s to both county and city; but
an act was only passed in the latter year. The first
writ was moved, it is said, in 1675; but the first
return is dated in Whitworth, 1679. (Oldfield's
<i>Parl. Hist.</i>, iii. 425.)</p>

<p>"<i>A Frog he would</i>," <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;I am in my sixth
decade, and pretty far on in it too; and I can recollect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>this jingle as long as I can recollect anything.
It formed several stanzas (five or six at
least), and had its own tune. There was something
peculiarly attractive and humorous to the
unformed ear and mind in the ballad, (for as a
ballad it was sung,) as I was wont to hear it. I
can therefore personally vouch for its antiquity
being half a century. But, beyond this, I must
add, that my early days being spent in a remote
provincial village (high up the Severn), and the
ballad, as I shall call it, being <i>universally known</i>, I
cannot help inferring that it is of considerable
antiquity. Anything of then recent date could
hardly be both generally known and universally
popular in such a district and amongst such a
people. Whether it had a local origin there or
not, it would be difficult to say but I never heard
it spoken of as having any special application to
local persons or affairs. Of course there are only
two ways of accounting for its popularity,&mdash;either
its application, or its jingle of words and tune. If
I may venture a "guess," it would be, that it had
originally a political application, in some period
when all men's minds were turned to some one
great politico-religious question; and this, not unlikely,
the period of the Cavaliers and Roundheads.
We know how rife this kind of warfare was in that
great struggle. Or again, it might be as old as
the Reformation itself, and have a reference to
Henry the Eighth and Anna Boleyn.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The frog he would a-wooing go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether his mother would let him or no,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>would not inaptly represent the "wide-mouthed
waddling frog" Henry&mdash;"mother church,"&mdash;and
the "gleesome Anna" would be the "merry
mouse in the mill." It may be worth the while of
gentlemen conversant with the ballad literature
and political squibs of both the periods here indicated,
to notice any traces in other squibs and
ballads of the same imagery that is employed in
this. It would also be desirable, if possible, to get
a complete copy of these verses. My own memory
can only supply a part, or rather disjointed parts:
but I think it probable that it may be easily obtained
by persons resident in the counties bordering
on North Wales, especially in Shropshire or
Herefordshire, and perhaps in Cheshire or Staffordshire.</p>

<p>I should not have thought of troubling you with
my own reminiscences as an answer to an antiquarian
question, but for the fact that even these
go further back than any information that has been
sent you.</p>

<p><i>To endeavour Ourselves&mdash;The Homilies.</i>&mdash;Perhaps
your correspondents G. P. (Vol. i., p 125.),
and C. I. R. (Vol. i., p. 285) may, from the following
passages, conclude that "ourselves", is the
object of the verb "endeavour."</p>

<blockquote><p>"He did this to this intent, 'that the whole clergy,
in the mean space, might apply themselves to prayer,
not doubting but that all his loving subjects would
occupy themselves to God's honour, and so endeavour
themselves that they may be more ready,'" &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Heylin,
<i>Hist. of the Reform. from an Act passed in
Edward VI.'s Reign</i>, 1548.</p>

<p>"Let us endeavour ourselves, both inwardly in our
hearts, and also outwardly with our bodies, diligently
to exercise this godly exercise of fasting."&mdash;<i>Homily
on Fasting</i> (end).</p>

<p>"Only show yourselves thankful in your lives, determine
with yourselves to refuse and avoid all such
things in your conversation as should offend his eyes of
mercy. Endeavour yourselves that way to rise up
again, which way ye fell into the well or pit of sin."&mdash;<i>Hom.
on the Resur.</i> (near the end).</p>

<p>"From henceforth let us endeavour ourselves to
walk in a new life."&mdash;<i>Hom. of Repentance</i>, Pt. 2. (end).</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many other similar passages in the
"Homilies". I have also noticed the following
Latimer's Sermons:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The devil, with no less diligence, endeavoureth
himself to let and stop our prayers."&mdash;Vol. i. p. 829.
Parker Soc. edit.</p>

<p>"Every patron, when he doth not diligently endeavor
himself to place a good and godly man in his
benefice, shall make answer before God."&mdash;Vol. ii.
p. 28.</p>

<p>"Let them endeavour themselves." [I have forgotten
the reference in this case, but it is in vol. i.]</p>

<p>"How much, then, should we endeavour ourselves
to make ready towards this day, when it shall not be
a money matter, but a soul matter." (ii. p. 62)</p></blockquote>

<p>As I am engaged on a work on the "Homilies,"
I should feel very grateful for any allusions to
them in writers between 1600 and 1650, and for
any notices of their being read in churches during
that period. Can any of your readers inform me
where the fullest account may be found of the
state of preaching in England prior to the Reformation?</p>

<p><i>Three Dukes</i> (Vol. ii., p. 9.).&mdash;The verses themselves
called them "three <i>bastard</i> dukes;" but
the only bastard duke I can find at that time was
the Duke of Monmouth; all the other creations of
the king's bastards were subsequent to that date.
And even if, by poetical licence or courtly anticipation,
they could be called <i>dukes</i>, they were all
too young to have any share in such a fray. I
must further observe, that <i>Evelyn's Diary</i> is silent
as to any such events, though he is, about that
time, justly indignant at the immoralities of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Court. The "park" referred to, but not named
in the verses, is the disreputable place called
"Whetstone Park," near Holborn.</p>

<p><i>Christabel</i> (Vol. i., p. 262.).&mdash;After a long hunt
among Manx and Highland superstitions, I have
just found that the passage I was in search of
belongs to "the Debateable Land."</p>

<blockquote><p>"'Reverend father,' replied Magdalen, 'hast thou
never heard that there are spirits powerful to rend the
walls of a castle asunder when once admitted, which
yet <i>cannot enter the house unless they are invited, nay,
dragged over the threshold</i>? Twice hath Roland Gr&#339;me
been thus drawn into the household of Avenel by those
who now hold the title. Let them look to the issue.'"&mdash;<i>The
Abbot</i>, chap. 15., ad fin., <i>and note</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Derivation of "Trianon"</i> (Vol. i., p. 439.; vol. ii.,
p. 13.).&mdash;Your correspondent <span class="smcap">Aredjid Kooes</span> is
certainly right: Trianon was the <i>name of a village</i>,
which formerly stood on the site of these two
chateaux. (See Vatout, and all the histories of
Versailles.) I would take this occasion of suggesting,
that it is essential to the value of your work
that your correspondents should be careful not to
<i>lead</i> us astray by mere <i>guesses</i>. What authority
has your correspondent J. K. R. W. (Vol. ii., p. 13.)
for asserting that "<i>trianon</i> is a word meaning a
<i>pavilion</i>?" And if, as I believe, he has not the
slightest, I appeal to him whether it is fair to the
public to assert it so confidently.</p>

<p>We recently called attention to Mr. Colburn's new
Edition of <i>The Diary and Correspondence of John
Evelyn</i>. We have now to announce from the same
publisher an inedited work by Evelyn, entitled <i>The
History of Religion</i>, to be printed from the original
MS. in the Library at Wotton. The work, which it
is said contains a condensed statement and investigation
of the natural and scriptural evidences, is the result of
an endeavour on Evelyn's part to satisfy himself amidst
the startling manifestations of infidelity, fanaticism, and
conflicting opinion by which he found himself surrounded.</p>

<p>Sir Fortunatus Dwarris has just put forth a privately
printed Letter to J. Payne Collier, Esq., in which he
endeavours to solve the great political Query of George
the Third's time. His pamphlet is called <i>Some new
Facts and a Suggested New Theory as to the Authorship
of the Letters of Junius</i>. Sir Fortunatus' theory, which
he supports with a good deal of amusing illustration
by way of proof, is, that Junius, to use the language of
Mark Tapley, was "a Co.," "that the writer was one,
but the abettors were many," that Sir Philip Francis
was the head of the Firm, but that among the sleeping
partners were Lords Temple, Chatham, and George
Sackville, the three Burkes, Colonel Barr&eacute;, Dyer,
Loyd, Boyd, and others.</p>
